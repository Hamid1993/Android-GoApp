GoApp is designed to give users the possibility to find their group (other users) on the way to a meeting (specific time and location). It uses live tracking through Google Maps and builds cluster with a certain density to show a group of users that are all located near each other (anonymous). Source code is available on request.

* "Standort teilen" means share location, it us up to the user whether he would like to share his location or not
* the green pin represents our current location while the red pin represents a cluster, several users at one point
* furthermore you see the list of participants and which of them are already active, meaning are getting to the specified location
